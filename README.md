This project is a Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System using Streamlit, simplifying book selection by recommending similar books based on user input. It provides a list of the top 10 similar books for a specific search, enhancing the reading experience. Hope you enjoy it:)


### Instructions how to go about it:
1. **Run this code for installation of necessary libraries :** ```!pip install streamlit pickle```(if required) <br><br>
2. **Run the contents of jupyter file 'Book Recommender.ipynb' , to get pickle files in pickle_files folder i.e `book_names.pkl` , `book_pivot.pkl` , `final_df.pkl` and `model.pkl`**<br><br>
3. **Open Anaconda Prompt, enter the current directory of the folder using 'cd' command :** ```cd folder_path```.
   <br>**For Example:** ```cd C:\Users\Desktop\Github\Book-RS-KNN-Clustering```<br><br> 
4. **Run this code after step 3 , to launch your streamlit app :** ```streamlit run app.py``` (make sure you have entered the current directory where app.py is present using 'cd' command)
